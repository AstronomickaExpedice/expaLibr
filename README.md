# expaLibr
A set of tools for an easier work with measured photometric data

The expaLibr Python library is a practical tool developed during the Expa 2.0 expedition by members of the CCD group Šimon Bláha and Marco Souza de Joode. The main goal was to develop a useful set of tools that would make some of the work that has to be done with measured data a little easier. Some graphical tools like the plotting functions are also introduced as well as functions correcting or rewriting outputs from programmes such as Muniwin or VaST. A function correcting (shifting) the time values in data files is also introduced.

We believe that the development of the library has yet to reach its maximum and that many other functions and tools will be introduced by other former or current expedition participants.
